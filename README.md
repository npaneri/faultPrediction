# Network Fault Prediction using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates a basic approach to predicting network faults using machine learning.

## Files:
* data.csv: Sample network data with features and target variable (fault).
* network_fault_prediction.py: Python script for training and prediction.
* network_fault_model.pkl: Saved model file (generated during training).

## Running the Project:

1. Ensure you have Python and required libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, pickle) installed.
2. Download the repository and navigate to the project directory.
3. (Optional) Replace the sample data in 'data.csv' with your own data.
4. Run the script: `python network_fault_prediction.py`

## How it Works:

1. The script loads the data from 'data.csv'.
2. It trains a Logistic Regression model to predict network faults based on features.
3. You can provide new network data for prediction through the script.

## Disclaimer:

This is a simplified example for demonstration purposes only. A real-world network fault prediction system would likely involve more complex models and data considerations.
